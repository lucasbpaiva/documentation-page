                    <p>
                        NumPy (<b>Numerical Python</b>) is an open source Python library that's used in almost every field of science and engineering. It's the universal standard for working with numerical data in Python, and it's at the core of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystems. NumPy users include everyone from beginning coders to experienced researchers doing state-of-the-art scientific and industrial research and development. The NumPy API is used extensively in Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, scikit-image and most other data science and scientific Python packages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The NumPy library contains multidimensional array and matrix data structures (you'll find more information about this in later sections). It provides <b>ndarray</b>, a homogeneous n-dimensional array object, with methods to efficiently operate on it. NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. It adds powerful data structures to Python that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.

                    <p>To install NumPy, we strongly recommend using a scientific Python distribution. If you're looking for the full instructions for installing NumPy on your operating system, see <a class="links" href="https://numpy.org/install/" target="_blank">Installing NumPy</a>.</p>
                    <p>
                        "If you already have Python, you can install NumPy with:"
                        <code>conda install numpy</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>or
                        <code>pip install numpy</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you don't have Python yet, you might want to consider using <a class="links" href="https://www.anaconda.com" target="_blank">Anaconda</a>. It's the easiest way to get started. The good thing about getting this distribution is the fact that you don't need to worry too much about separately installing NumPy or any of the major packages that you'll be using for your data analyses, like pandas, Scikit-Learn, etc.

                <article>
                    <p>To access NumPy and its functions import it in your Python code like this:
                        <code><span class="import">import</span> numpy <span class="import">as</span> np</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We shorten the imported name to <span class="pink">np</span> for better readability of code using NumPy. This is a widely adopted convention that makes your code more readable for everyone working on it. We recommend to always use import numpy as <span class="pink">np</span>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you aren't already comfortable with reading tutorials that contain a lot of code, you might not know how to interpret a code block that looks like this:
                        <code><span class="input">>>></span> a <span class="o">=</span> np<span class="o">.</span>arange<b>(</b><span class="number">6</span><b>)</b>
                            <span class="input">>>></span> a2 <span class="o">=</span> a<b>[</b>np<span class="o">.</span>newaxis<b>, :]</b>
                            <span class="input">>>></span> a2<span class="o">.</span>shape
                            <i>(1, 6)</i>
                        </code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you aren't familiar with this style, it's very easy to understand. If you see <span class="pink">>>></span>, you're looking at <b>input</b>, or the code that you would enter. Everything that doesn't have <span class="pink">>>></span> in front of it is <b>output</b>, or the results of running your code. This is the style you see when you run <span class="pink">python</span> on the command line, but if you're using IPython, you might see a different style. Note that it is not part of the code and will cause an error if typed or pasted into the Python shell. It can be safely typed or pasted into the IPython shell; the <span class="pink">>>></span> is ignored.

                <header>What's the difference between a Python list and a NumPy array?</header>

                    <p>
                        NumPy gives you an enormous range of fast and efficient ways of creating arrays and manipulating numerical data inside them. While a Python list can contain different data types within a single list, all of the elements in a NumPy array should be homogeneous. The mathematical operations that are meant to be performed on arrays would be extremely inefficient if the arrays weren't homogeneous.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Why use NumPy?</b></p>
                    <p>
                        NumPy arrays are faster and more compact than Python lists. An array consumes less memory and is convenient to use. NumPy uses much less memory to store data and it provides a mechanism of specifying the data types. This allows the code to be optimized even further.

                    <p>
                        An array is a central data structure of the NumPy library. An array is a grid of values and it contains information about the raw data, how to locate an element, and how to interpret an element. It has a grid of elements that can be indexed in <a class="links" href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html#quickstart-indexing-slicing-and-iterating" target="_blank">various ways</a>. The elements are all of the same type, referred to as the array <span class="pink">dtype</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An array can be indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers, by booleans, by another array, or by integers. The <span class="pink">rank</span> of the array is the number of dimensions. The <span class="pink">shape</span> of the array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One way we can initialize NumPy arrays is from Python lists, using nested lists for two- or higher-dimensional data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example:
                        <code><span class="input">>>></span> a <span class="o">=</span> np<span class="o">.</span>array<b>([</b><span class="number">1</span><b>,</b> <span class="number">2</span><b>,</b> <span class="number">3</span><b>,</b> <span class="number">4</span><b>,</b> <span class="number">5</span><b>,</b> <span class="number">6</span><b>])</b></code>
                        or:
                        <code><span class="input">>>></span> a <span class="o">=</span> np<span class="o">.</span>array<b>([</b><b>[</b><span class="number">1</span><b>,</b> <span class="number">2</span><b>,</b> <span class="number">3</span><b>,</b> <span class="number">4</span><b>], </b><b>[</b><span class="number">5</span><b>,</b> <span class="number">6</span><b>,</b> <span class="number">7</span><b>,</b> <span class="number">8</span><b>], </b><b>[</b><span class="number">9</span><b>,</b> <span class="number">10</span><b>,</b> <span class="number">11</span><b>,</b> <span class="number">12</span><b>]</b><b>])</b></code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can access the elements in the array using square brackets. When you're accessing elements, remember that indexing in NumPy starts at 0. That means that if you want to access the first element in your array, you'll be accessing element “0”.
                        <code><span class="input">>>></span> <span class="print">print</span><b>(</b>a<b>[</b><span class="number">0</span><b>])</b>
                            <i>[1 2 3 4]</i>
                        </code>
